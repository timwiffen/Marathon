3. A warning is displayed when a component uses indexOfType for object recognition.
4. During recording, errors are displayed in the control center window.

Fixed:

1. Comment for setup method of Fixtures.

2. WindowID creator throwing an exception in rare cases.
3. MComboBox#getStringRep creating a JList() in non-EDT thread.
4. Component Not Found exception with Marathon#frame method. Mostly because of missing FOCUS_GAINED event.

an addition of 'type' in recognition properties.

in the runtime naming cache.

[2011-06-18]
* Fixed:
1. Added MarathonMode (Recording, Other). Skip saving ObjectMap if it is not in recording mode.

* Fixed Bugs:
1. A toggle button will be recorded always. This is required for recording state when the toggle buttons are used
as toolbar buttons as in SwingSet2 sample.

* Fixed Bug:
1. SwingSet2 example: keystroke SHIFT+F10 opens a popup menu, but it disappears before the menu item is selected while
playing. This happens only on Windows. The reason being that the release event posted (on the old component) is causing
the focus to change (guess). Fixed it by checking that the component focus did not change before posting the release
event.


[2011-06-17]

1. NPE in DisplayWindow when MarathonITE commands are invoked without an active editor.
